I created documentation by downloading the HTML of the puzzle descriptions and
converting them to markdown with

    FILES=*.html
    for f in $FILES
    do
      filename="${f%.*}"
      echo "Converting $f to $filename.md"
      `pandoc "$f" -f html -t markdown -o "$filename.md"`
    done

I prefixed the `#' ` to each line with

    sed -i -e "s/^/#' /" file

I had to remove the easter egg title tags to not upset the Roxygen2 conversion.

This approach worked flawlessly for every day except Day09 in which the puzzle
description had lots of braces which the RD format hates.
